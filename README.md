## dm-Vibrato

A mono vibrato effect written in Rust.

---

**This is a forked version for use within Darkglass which modifies the LV2 version.**  
**The URI has also been changed as to not conflict with the original.**

List of changes so far:
- Added dg:abbreviation, for Anagram
- Added lv2:enabled control, for smooth bypass
- Removed "chance" control
- Removed "Sample&Hold" and "Random" shape types, hid "Saw up", "Saw down" and "Square"
- Removed modgui
- Reorder ports matching other Darkglass plugins
- Added reset port and its implementation (resetting memory and smoothed values jumping straight to targets)
- Renamed "Freq" parameter to "Rate" to match other Darkglass plugins and limit it's range

The original README contents follows after this line.

The effect can be compiled to a [MOD audio](https://mod.audio/), VST3, CLAP, AUv2 or LV2 plugin.

## VST3, CLAP, AUv2 & LV2 installation

You can download the VST3, CLAP, AUv2 (macOS only) & LV2 plugins from the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Vibrato/releases).

The LV2 plugin doesn't have a GUI unless you run the plugin in MOD Desktop.

On macOS you may need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/) as Apple has recently made it more difficult to run unsigned code on macOS.

## MOD installation

Install the plugin from the MOD Audio plugin store.

The latest MOD builds can also be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Vibrato/releases).

If you want to build the plugin on your own machine check out the [mod-plugin-builder repository](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder) for instructions.
